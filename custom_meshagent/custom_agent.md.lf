# Custom MeshAgent Toolkit\n\nThis repository collects documentation and build scripts for producing\nbranded MeshAgent binaries (standard and SOS variants) tailored for\nMeshCentral deployments. The focus is on service/process renaming,\ncustom install footprints, network obfuscation, and automated\npackaging/testing.\n\n## Quick Start (Design\nIN PROGRESS)\n- Review `docs/MESHAGENT_CUSTOM_BUILD_PLAN.md` for the full blueprint.\n- Prepare a Windows build host with the MeshCentral source tree and\n  required toolchains (MSVC/MinGW, NSIS, PowerShell, Authenticode certs).\n- Follow the implementation roadmap to automate fetch → patch →\n  compile → package → sign.\n\n## Repository Layout\n```\ndocs/   # Plans, SOPs, design notes\nscripts/ (future) build automation\npackaging/ (future) installers and resources\n```\n\n> Note: This repository currently contains planning artifacts only. Code\n> modules and build automation will be added during implementation.\n
