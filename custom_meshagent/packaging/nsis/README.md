# NSIS Packaging

Placeholder for Windows NSIS installers. Scripts here should:
- Install to the branded install root.
- Register the custom service name (and optional svchost loader).
- Configure persistence (Run key, scheduled task, WMI subscription) based on
  the selected profile.
- Install logs and configuration files to the new locations.

Implementation deferred to Windows environment.
